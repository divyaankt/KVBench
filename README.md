# KVBench

Through KVBench, we have performed reproducible, preliminary benchmarking of Apache Ignite, Apache Cassandra, TikV and etcd using [YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB) workloads.

This work was done as a part of our Course Project for [CSE 590: Distributed and Decentralized Data Management](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~amiri/teaching/dddm/24s/index.html), taught by [Prof. Mohammad Javad Amiri](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~amiri/) at Stony Brook University in Spring 2024.

The benchmarks were performed on [CloudLab](https://www.cloudlab.us/)
